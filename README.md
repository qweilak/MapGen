# MapGen
Is a personal project to procedurally generate a grid of 2D tiles by theme. The map generated with this grid has size limits bound to the size of the screen.

It has a spawn chance for each tile depending on the chance assigned to themes.

Currently the tiles are generated using spriteRenderers later it will change to Unity3D tilemap system.

The art of the project is from kenney art.
